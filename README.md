# ðŸ‘Š Welcome!

The Blue Team Toolkit provides tools and techniques for Digital Forensics and Incident Response. The Blue Team Toolkit was created by [@EvolvingSysadmin](https://github.com/evolvingsysadmin). The information is gathered primarily from courses such as those from [Security Blue Team](https://securityblue.team/).

In addition to [GitHub](https://github.com/EvolvingSysadmin/Blue-Team-Toolkit), the Blue Team Toolkit can be viewed as a GitBook at <https://blueteam.ryanheavican.com> or downloaded as a [markdown file](assets/README.md).
