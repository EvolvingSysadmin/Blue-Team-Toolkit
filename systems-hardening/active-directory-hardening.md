Regularly monitor the environment for suspicious activity, including unauthorized access attempts and unusual login patterns.

Apply security patches and updates to your systems and software in a timely manner, to help reduce the risk of known vulnerabilities being exploited.

Ensure that your systems are configured securely, and that you have implemented appropriate security controls, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and data encryption.

Regularly perform penetration testing and vulnerability assessments to identify potential security weaknesses and to help validate the effectiveness of your security controls.
